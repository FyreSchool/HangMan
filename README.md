# Overview


This Program is the game Hangman. This game involves trying to guess a word before a specified number of attempts have been used. I have used C++ a little before but havenâ€™t done very many projects with it. 
I really enjoy creating and playing games of all kinds and so I thought build a game would be a great way to get back into programing C++. I wanted to experiment with classes in C++ and see how I could implement them in this project.
I also wanted to see how I could implement some sort of a random function so that the word would be random every time that someone played the game. It is different to implement it with every language, but it was not too hard to make it 
so that the word would be random every game. It was really fun to start programing in C++ again and would like to build some more projects with it in the future.
